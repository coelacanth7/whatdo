This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

I just made this project for fun to explore react-native. The app uses your phones location and google maps api to find the names of bars around you.

In order to get it running run:

```
npm i && npm start
```

create a config.json file that has field `API_KEY` and use a google maps api API_KEY
